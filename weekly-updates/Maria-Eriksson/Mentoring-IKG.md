### General discussion about what both would like to achieve from these mentoring sessions

* IKG
* ME

### What brought you joy this week?

* IKG
  * Having some weight lifted off my shoulders at uni!
* ME
  * Spending time with friends in Finland :love_letter: I haven't had an extended bit of time in Finland since... I moved. So it's been really nice having lots of catch-ups, instead of having to squeeze everyone into a single weekend.
  * Lil Louie :dog::heartbeat:
  * Getting into GitHub has been so FUN. Didn't think I'd have as much fun as I'm having :dancer:
  * I looooved LC's talk at lab meeting :raised_hands:

### What did you achieve

* IKG
  * Meeting with ME! Haha
* ME
  * Set up a GitHub repo for a paper I'd like to publish :tada: How exciting! I've gotten most of my scripts moved over, and am loving the structure and organisation it is bringing to my work habits :surfer:
  * Finished cleaning my seizure/AED outcome data wohooo :muscle:
  * Reached out to HJ (Engage@Turing student) and had a lovely chat :coffee: I pitched having co-working sessions with Engage@Turing students - let's see if the other reps like the idea... ðŸ‘€
  * Had a great mentoring session with IS - super excited to incorporate her feedback into my script! :pray:
  * Attended a bunch of talks & seminars: HDRUK Turing Health Data Science Seminar, Developmental Neuroscience Seminar, Turing Student Seminar, BRC Symposium, ICH Neurosciences Seminar.
  * Had some lovely co-working sessions with my data buds :sparkling_heart:
  * I was invited to collaborate on a study with a new PhD student/surgeon trainee, and provided feedback on the project proposal.

### What did you struggle with?

* IKG
  * Probably not being in the right headspace to answer this is one form of this past week's struggle, haha
* ME
  * Had so MUCH to organise before my flight back to London. And felt quite unwell as a result. Glad that's done. Phew.
  * I'm stuck in my cross-validation script. But I'm thinking I'll come back to it after I wrap things up with the paper/new repo.

### What do you need help with? or need an opinion on?
* IKG
  * The EAG report! Still going through all your and Patricia's helpful comments!
* ME
  * I was approached by someone who wants my input on ethics in AI & epilepsy research. Sooooo any resources would be mega helpful...!
